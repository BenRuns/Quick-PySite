###Udacity Project Instructions
1. Install Python.

2. Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.

3. Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.

4. To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud036/fresh_tomatoes.py) - this module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.

5. Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.
